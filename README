Vectir is a Tetris clone, but primarily an attempt to get a working 2D game 
engine up and running. It is written using C and the SDL libs and as such, 
you will need to have SDL installed on your system.

Testing/Dev has been done using both Linux and Windows XP, so it should 
compile on both.

It is still a work in progress, so use with caution.
